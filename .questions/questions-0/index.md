Q: What is a javascript REPL? Can you name two ways to open one?

A: {YOUR ANSWER HERE}
js Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL) is an interactive shell that processes Node. js expressions. The shell reads JavaScript code the user enters, evaluates the result of interpreting the line of code, prints the result to the user, and loops until the user signals to quit.


To start the REPL in VS code, open the command palette and search for and select “Start REPL”. The advantage to starting the REPL from inside VS Code is that it respects the environment you already set up, that is the version of Python you chose earlier.
